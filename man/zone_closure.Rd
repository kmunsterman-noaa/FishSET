\usage{
zone_closure(
  project,
  spat,
  cat,
  secondspat = NULL,
  secondcat = NULL,
  lon.spat = NULL,
  lat.spat = NULL,
  epsg = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{project}{Required, name of project.}

\item{spat}{Required, data file or character. 
\code{spat} is a spatial data file containing information on fishery 
management or regulatory zones boundaries. Shape, json, geojson, and csv 
formats are supported. geojson is the preferred format. json files must be 
converted into geoson. This is done automatically when the file is loaded 
with \code{\link{read_dat}} with \code{is.map} set to true. \code{spat} 
cannot, at this time, be loaded from the FishSET database. \cr}

\item{cat}{Variable in \code{spat} that identifies the individual areas or zones.}

\item{secondspat}{Optional spatial data file containing information to 
aid in defining zone closures, such as location of windmills.}

\item{secondcat}{Optional, name of variable that identifies individual areas 
in \code{secondspat}}

\item{lon.spat}{Required for csv files. Variable or list from \code{spat} 
containing longitude data. Leave as NULL if \code{spat} is a shape or json file.}

\item{lat.spat}{Required for csv files. Variable or list from \code{spat} 
containing latitude data.  Leave as NULL if \code{spat} is a shape or json file.}

\item{epsg}{EPSG number. Set the epsg to ensure that \code{spat} and 
\code{secondspat} have the same projections. If epsg is not specified but is defined for 
\code{spat}, then the \code{secondspat} epsg will be applied to \code{spat}. 
See \url{http://spatialreference.org/} to help identify optimal epsg number.}

Returns a yaml file to the project output folder.

\description{
Define zone closure scenarios
}
\details{
Define zone closure scenarios. Function opens an interactive map. 
  Define zone closures by clicking on one or more zones and clicking the 
  'Close zones' button. To define another closure scenario, unclick zones and 
  then click the desired zones. Press the 'Save closures' button to save choices.
  The saved choices are called in the policy scenario function.
